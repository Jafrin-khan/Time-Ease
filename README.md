# Time-Ease

Project Name : Chrome Extension

Name of contributors : Jafrin Khan

About the project : The developed chrome extension is the requirement of every student and professional in tech where all the information is compiled together and presented on a single platform. The user can make foreign calls, search on Google, move to Github or LinkedIn and have a glance of their current timezone if they travel a lot. This reduces the efforts of the user to keep on searching on the browser for basic daily needs thus increasing their efficiency and productivity hence this chrome extension earned its name 'Time Ease'.
