# Time-Ease

Project Name : Chrome Extension

Name of contributors : Jafrin Khan

About the project : The developed chrome extension is the requirement of every student and professional in tech where all the information is compiled together and presented on a single platform. The user can make foreign calls, search on Google, move to Github or LinkedIn and have a glance of their current timezone if they travel a lot. This reduces the efforts of the user to keep on searching on the browser for basic daily needs thus increasing their efficiency and productivity hence this chrome extension earned its name 'Time Ease'.

Technical Stacks Used : HTML, CSS, Javascript

Week-wise Progress : 

Week 1 : Developed the basic layout of the extension by writing HTML and creating the manifest.json file

week 2 : Styled the extension using CSS and gave some functioning using Javascript.

week 3 : Gave the final touch and pushed it into gitHub did some minor changes to showcase the final project

Conclusion : The chrome extension is fully functional and ready to use on the daily basis.

Future Scope : Intend to add the voice assistant and a search bar in the future to increase the functionality and make the project more effective.
